- The project itself is fully commented and with easy access to both the main code and the commented code.
- The game has all the necessary libraries in all files, meaning there is no need to download anything to play.
- The project documentation already contains all the objectives, preparations and conclusions during the creation of the game.
- Good use, and thanks for playing! ;)
